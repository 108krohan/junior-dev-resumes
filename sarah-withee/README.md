# Readme

I started off with a simple one-page resume. As I started working on more projects, and doing more after school activities, I found out it was hard to maintain a one page one, so I made a longer version and a shorter version. I'd take both to career fairs and offer the summary or the full detailed one. I'd probably now just take the longer one since it can fit front and back nicely, and most places just took a picture of it anyway.

Hopefully there's enough sections or ideas other juniors can gather from this to make their own resumes.    

# Questions

* Have you written code for a company before? *
I had two internships where I now have code that is in production. 

* How many years have you been programming? *
I started programming on the Commodore 64 when I was little. I basically have been programming in some capacity all my life, but I really only consider my experience from college on.

* What, if anything, has been the difficult part about developer job seeking? *
Probably just the interviews. It's hard to try to sell yourself as being wonderful and smart and perfectly capable for the job when you're fresh out of college (or about to be) and to be turned down by companies. I probably interviewed with about 6 different places before one finally hired me. It's discouraging to get several rejections, but just keep going and realize each interview makes you better.
