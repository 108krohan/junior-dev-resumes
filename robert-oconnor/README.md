# Have you written code for a company before?

No, sadly not. All of my work has been Open Source.

# How many years have you been programming?

I have been programming for the better part of 5+ years. I have a BA in
Computer Science from Hunter College and have been contributing regularly to Open Source over the past couple years. I am a programming polyglot.

Lately I've been doing Infrastructure work for [OpenMRS](http://openmrs.org) and maintaining and supporting their Identity Systems.



# What, if anything, has been the difficult part about developer job seeking?

My lack of professional experience has led to a lot of rejections sadly. Nobody
seems to want a guy who can learn fast, they want somebody who knows what they need now.
