1. **Have you written code for a company before?**

  Yes. As of this writing, I have seventeen months experience at a startup with a development team of two.

2. **How many years have you been programming?**

  I have been coding for three years total. I began by attending local meetups and attending a code school.

3. **What, if anything, has been the difficult part about developer job seeking?**

  Technically, the biggest challenge is understanding where the edges are between all the tools you're often learning at once, as well as what path to take to build a marketable skill set in the giant forest of options.

  During the job hunt itself, keeping confidence, knowing that your skills are useful (no matter how underdeveloped they may be), and knowing how much money to ask for are the hardest parts. I highly recommend watching this [video on salary negotiation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asq3pI9bJFY) to help you understand the value of your skills and what you should expect from a company.
